# ML code

Code used to build Machine Learning models for single cell prediction of classes using tcycif features.


## Description of files:

- Choice_of_model_202403.ipynb: compares 9 ML models on the pre-processed single cell dataset
- Four_classes_preds.ipynb: creates RF model for predictions of 4 molecular profiles on the pre-processed single cell dataset
- Three_classes_preds.ipynb: creates RF model for predictions of 3 molecular profiles on the pre-processed single cell dataset
- Two_classes_preds.ipynb: creates RF model for predictions of 2 molecular profiles on the pre-processed single cell dataset

All files employ PyCaret library.
